# About Me 🌟

👋 Hi! I’m a CSE Student at Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST) 🎌, currently in my third year.  
In the past, I completed advanced studies at Gammal Tech 🐪, where I dove deep into C, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Problem-solving is my passion, and I love honing my skills through challenges on LeetCode 💻. I aim to apply my knowledge in impactful ways, continually pushing the limits of what I can create! 💡

## My Core Skills 🎯

- **Problem Solving** 🧩: I enjoy creating smart solutions, whether for coding challenges or real-world problems.
- **Code Tracing & Debugging** 🔍: I’m good at finding and fixing issues to make sure the code works smoothly.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** 📊: With a solid base in these areas, I write code that’s both effective and efficient.
- **C++ Skills** 💻: I know C++ well and use it to build strong, reliable programs.
